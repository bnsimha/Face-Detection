# Face Detection System using OpenCV

This repository contains a comprehensive face detection system implemented using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The system detects faces in images or video streams, providing a foundation for various applications such as surveillance, biometrics, and augmented reality.

Features
1. Real-time Face Detection
Utilizes OpenCV's existent data to detect faces in real-time from video streams or webcam feeds.
Implements efficient algorithms for face detection, ensuring high accuracy and speed.

3. Multi-face Detection
Supports detection of multiple faces within an image or video frame simultaneously.
Provides bounding box coordinates and confidence scores for each detected face.
